flask-git
=========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drivet/flask-git.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/drivet/flask-git)

Flask extension to provide basic manipulation (initialization, commit object
fetching) of git repositories.  More than that is not supported at the
moment, though I suppose this project could be used as the kernal of
something more ambitious.
